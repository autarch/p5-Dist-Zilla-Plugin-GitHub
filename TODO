- TESTS!!!
    - fill in skeletal test for [GitHub::Update]
    - test other plugins, command.

- dump configs in other plugins
- no documentation for 'repo' option.

Config::Identity has a terrible interface. it loads all credentials into a hash,
and then you use regular hash access to select which key you want. so we're
exposing a bunch of data to the application, most of which it shouldn't see...

and also CI doesn't support anything but GPG. it needs to support OSX Keychain!
